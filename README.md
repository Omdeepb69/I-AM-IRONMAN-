# JARVIS: Just Another Really Very Intelligent System for AR Suits

![Iron Man AR](https://api.placeholder.com/400/320)

## "Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk" - Tony Stark

Welcome to your very own Iron Man AR experience! This little piece of Stark Tech lets you become the Armored Avenger without the whole "almost dying in a cave" backstory. Consider it the PG version of becoming a superhero.

## What This Baby Can Do

This isn't some cheap Halloween costume app. This is **bleeding-edge** tech that would make Justin Hammer weep with jealousy:

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: The gauntlet follows your hand movements like it's magnetically attached. Physics? What physics?
- **Face Helmet Projection**: For when you want to look cool but don't want people to know you're rolling your eyes at their suggestions.
- **Gesture Controls**: Make a fist to deploy your repulsor gauntlet. Make a peace sign to deploy your helmet. Much easier than saying "Mark 42" and hoping your furniture doesn't attack you.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Automatically scales to your hand and face dimensions. One size fits most. Hulk users may experience some limitations.

## Installation

What, you thought this would build itself? Even I had to construct my first suit by hand.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy ursina

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/I-AM-IRONMAN-.git

# Navigate to the project
cd I-AM-IRONMAN-

# Run the program
python main.py
```

## System Requirements

- **Processor**: Something built after the Stone Age (preferably not by Hammer Industries)
- **Camera**: Webcam that doesn't make you look like you're transmitting from the 90s
- **RAM**: Enough to run the program without your computer sounding like it's about to achieve sentience and rebel
- **Python**: Version 3.6+ (We're not savages)

## How To Use

1. **Launch the program**: Double-click or run from terminal like a pro
2. **Stand in front of camera**: Make sure your face and hands are visible (wearing clothes is recommended but optional)
3. **Make a fist**: Deploy/retract your hand gauntlet
4. **Make a peace sign**: Deploy/retract your face helmet
5. **Strike heroic poses**: This step is mandatory

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My hand tracking isn't working.**  
**A:** Are you sure you have a hand? Just checking.

**Q: The helmet is too small for my face.**  
**A:** The helmet scales to your face. If it's too small, you might have a bigger head than you think. Happens to the best of us.

**Q: Can I shoot actual repulsor beams?**  
**A:** No. This is AR, not an actual weaponized suit. If you want to blow things up, go play a video game like a normal person.

**Q: The app crashes when I run it.**  
**A:** Have you tried turning it off and on again? Works 12% of the time, every time.

## Known Issues

- May cause delusions of grandeur
- Will not protect you from actual supervillains
- Does not include JARVIS AI (I'm not giving away all my tech)
- Cannot fly (yet)

## License

MIT License, because even I, Tony Stark, believe in open source... to an extent. Don't make me regret this.

## Credits

Built with the computing power of a mortal, but the genius of... well, not quite Stark-level, but you're getting there.

## Disclaimer

This software does not make you invincible. If you put on this AR suit and try to fight crime, I am not responsible for the inevitable embarrassment that follows. Leave the hero work to the professionals.

*"If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."* - Also me, being profound

Just kidding. Or am I?
